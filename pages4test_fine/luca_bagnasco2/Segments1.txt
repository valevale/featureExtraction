Recently, ABA has been also identified as an endogenous hormone in mammals, regulating different cell functions including inflammatory processes, stem cell expansion, insulin release, and glucose uptake. Aptamers are short, single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotidesable to recognize target molecules with high affinity. The small size of the ABA molecule represented a challenge for aptamer development and the aim of this study was to develop specific anti-ABA DNA aptamers. Biotinylated abscisic acid (bio-ABA) was immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. DNA aptamers against bio-ABA were selected with 7 iterative rounds of the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment method (SELEX), each round comprising incubation of the ABA-binding beads with the ssDNA sequences, DNA elution, electrophoresis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR product was cloned and sequenced. The binding affinity of several clones was determined using bio-ABA immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates. Aptamer 2 and aptamer 9 showed the highest binding affinity, with dissociation constants values of 0.98 ± 0.14 μM and 0.80 ± 0.07 μM, respectively. Aptamers 2 and 9 were also able to bind free, unmodified ABA and to discriminate between different ABA enantiomers and isomers. Our findings indicate that ssDNA aptamers can selectively bind ABA and could be used for the development of ABA quantitation assays.

We have previously reported that double transgenic mice obtained from crossing neu+ mice with mice transgenic for the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene can be used as a suitable model to test the &#39;suicide gene&#39; strategy for mammary tumor gene therapy in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the HSVtk/ganciclovir (GCV) system in the neu+ mice by inoculating cells producing a retroviral vector bearing the HSVtk gene in the mammary tumors on one side of the animals, and comparing their weight with that of the contralateral tumors, after systemic GCV administration. A statistically significant effect of this therapy was clearly seen (P &lt; 0.001) but complete eradication of the tumors could not be achieved. This was not due to the inefficient delivery of GCV,...

We have developed a transgenic mouse model for the analysis of toxic inorganic compounds. We engineered a mouse lineage with the human growth hormone (hGH) gene under the control of the human hsp70 promoter, in which a plasma-detectable hGH response can be elicited by exposure to heat shock. In primary cell cultures from these mice, hGH release was observed following treatment with several toxic inorganics. Transgenic mice injected intraperitoneally with sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, copper sulphate, or methylmercurium chloride showed significant hGH levels in plasma.

We have previously reported that double transgenic mice obtained from crossing neu+ mice with mice transgenic for the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene can be used as a suitable model to test the &#39;suicide gene&#39; strategy for mammary tumor gene therapy in vivo. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the HSVtk/ganciclovir (GCV) system in the neu+ mice by inoculating cells producing a retroviral vector bearing the HSVtk gene in the mammary tumors on one side of the animals, and comparing their weight with that of the contralateral tumors, after systemic GCV administration. A statistically significant effect of this therapy was clearly seen (P &lt; 0.001) but complete eradication of the tumors could not be achieved. This was not due to the inefficient delivery of GCV,...
